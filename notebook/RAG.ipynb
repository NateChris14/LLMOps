       "'<think>\\nOkay, so the user is asking about Cadillac\\'s debut livery for the 2026 F1 season. Let me check the provided documents.\\n\\nFirst, the context mentions that Cadillac revealed their livery during the Super Bowl. The documents talk about a \"FIRST LOOK\" and that they unveiled the design during a TV advert at the Super Bowl. Also, they mentioned showcasing the colors for their 2026 car. Another part says the car had a special livery with founding names during the Barcelona Shakedown. \\n\\nWait, the user is asking specifically about the debut livery. The key points are the Super Bowl reveal and the colors. The Barcelona Shakedown had a special livery with names, but maybe that\\'s a different event. The main debut was during the Super Bowl. The answer should mention the Super Bowl as the event where they showed the livery first. Also, the livery colors were showcased there. The documents don\\'t specify exact colors but mention they revealed the design during that event. So the answer should state that Cadillac debuted their 2026 livery during the Super Bowl via a TV ad. Also, mention the Barcelona Shakedown had a special livery with founders\\' names. Need to check if that\\'s part of the debut or a separate event. The Barcelona part is about initial testing with a special livery, which might be part of the debut process. So the answer should include both the Super Bowl reveal and the Barcelona Shakedown with the special livery. Make sure to keep it concise and within ten sentences. Also, confirm that the user is asking about the debut livery, which is the main one from the Super Bowl. The answer should combine both events if they are part of the same livery or different. Since the Barcelona one has founding names, maybe it\\'s a different livery, but the main debut is Super Bowl. Need to clarify that the Super Bowl was the official debut, and Barcelona was an initial test with a special version. So the answer should state that the debut livery was revealed during the Super Bowl, and during testing in Barcelona they used a special livery with names. That way, both pieces of info are covered without confusion.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe Cadillac team debuted their 2026 F1 livery during the Super Bowl, revealed via a television advertisement. The design was showcased alongside the Seattle Seahawks and featured colors set for their 2026 car. Additionally, during the Barcelona Shakedown, their new car sported a special livery with the names of the founding team members. This marked their first public appearance in Formula 1.'"
